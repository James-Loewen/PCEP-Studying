### The exam is broken down into 4 sections:
1. [Section 1](#computer-programming-and-python-fundamentals) &rarr; 7 items (18%)
    - [Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals](./computer_programming_and_python_fundamentals.py)
2. [Section 2](#control-flow--conditional-blocks-and-loops) &rarr; 8 items (29%)
    - [Control Flow — Conditional Blocks and Loops](./control_flow.py)
3. [Section 3](#data-collections--tuples-dictionaries-lists-and-strings) &rarr; 7 items (25%)
    - [Data Collections — Tuples, Dictionaries, Lists, and Strings](./data_collections.py)
4. [Section 4](#functions-and-exceptions) &rarr; 8 items (28%)
    - [Functions and Exceptions](./functions_and_exceptions.py)

### The exam will consist of 30 questions which could be:

## [Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals](./computer_programming_and_python_fundamentals.py)

Things I need to study:
- Reading up about the interpreter and the compiler
- Reading up about python lexical analysis and edge-case syntax
- Scientific notation
- Binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal numeral systems
- Naming conventions and PEP-8 recommendations
- Operators and data types adequate to the problem
    - unary and binary operators
    - bitwise operators `~&^|<<>>`
- The accuracy of floating-point numbers
- The `input()` and `print()` functions with `sep=` and `end=` keyword params
- Variables and Objects (P3P Python Basics Week 4)

---

## [Control Flow — Conditional Blocks and Loops](./control_flow.py)

Things I need to study:
- Conditional statements syntax
    - Specifically weird edge-case/one-line statements
- `while`-`else` and `for`-`else` loops (never seen these before...)
- Revisit `pass`, `break` and `continue`

---

## [Data Collections — Tuples, Dictionaries, Lists, and Strings](./data_collections.py)

Things I need to study:
- Constructing vectors (I don't know what this even means...)
- Go over indexing and slicing (Reread PY4E Data Structures weeks 4 and 5)
- Read up on the `del` instruction
- Review list comprehension (P3P Data Collection Week 2)
- Revisit copying and cloning (P3P Python Basics Week 4)

## [Functions and Exceptions](./functions_and_exceptions.py)

Things I need to study:
- `*args` and `**kwargs`
    - Remember: `*` is for tuples/lists. `**` is for dictionaries.
